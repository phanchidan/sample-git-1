# sample-git-1: Sample repository for testing Github

The *purpose* of writing this file is to train using the **Markdown** notation.

# OVERVIEW

The Markdown notation features several very interesting capabilities such as:
- Making lists (itemized or numbered + hierarchical)
- Making tables
- Inserting links (internal or external references)
- Inserting images
- Inserting separators
- Inserting code blocks (with colored syntax)

Each of above items can be achieved using an easy and quite straightforward syntax.
